// Guard for the @rivetkit/framework-base getParams patch.
//
// The reactive-actor path (apps/web BaseActorViewModel) mints a FRESH auth token
// on every connect AND reconnect by passing `getParams` to createReactiveActor.
// Stock @rivetkit/framework-base@2.3.5 does NOT forward `getParams` from
// ActorOptions down to the rivetkit client's get()/getOrCreate() calls — the
// forwarding is added by the root patch `patches/@rivetkit%2Fframework-base@2.3.5.patch`
// (registered in root package.json `patchedDependencies`, keyed to EXACT "2.3.5").
//
// RISK this guards: if the dep ever bumps off exact 2.3.5, bun silently skips the
// version-keyed patch, getParams forwarding vanishes, and every actor reconnect
// replays a FROZEN token. This test reads the INSTALLED dist that the runtime
// actually loads and fails loudly the moment the patch stops applying.
//
// Why read the dist instead of importing the module: `create()` (the function
// that forwards getParams) is an internal, non-exported function — there is no
// runtime seam to assert against. Every other test in this dir vi.mock()s the
// whole package, so none exercise the real patched dist. A static read is the
// only faithful guard.
//
// NOTE: This targets @rivetkit/framework-base (stock npm + root patch).
// It is NOT the forked `rivetkit` runtime at packages/vendored/rivetkit
// (2.3.5-layerr.0, via root `overrides`) — a different package, out of scope.
